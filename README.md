## Dataset Overview
The dataset provides valuable information on various aspects of data-related roles, including work year, job title, salary, experience level, and more. Check the [Kaggle dataset page](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hummaamqaasim/jobs-in-data) for a detailed description.

## Analysis Goals
The primary goals of this analysis include exploring temporal salary trends, understanding role-specific salary distributions, and examining the impact of factors such as experience level, employment type, and company size on salaries in the data industry.

## Machine Learning Prediction
In addition to exploratory analysis, this project extends to predicting salaries using machine learning algorithms. The Jupyter Notebook (`data_job_analysis.ipynb`) includes a section where a machine learning model is trained to predict salaries based on relevant features.
